# Info
**Compiler type interpreter** is module for parsing, syntax analyzing and executing algorithms.

***Compiler type interpreter*** is a system consists of ***compiler***, transformed source code to intermediate code, example bite-code or p-code, and ***interpret***, that execute got intermediate code (***virtual machine***).

## Principles of interpreter
- Have methods for modifying code in interpreting by **unload, changing then loading changed module of code**;
- Have way to **determinate changed of code** (may be code will have integer of changing for ***determinate current version in interpretator***);
- Have parser, syntax and semantic analyzer methods for checking correction of code;
- Have methods for working with **other system modules only in specific code modules**;
- Have **static** variable of [[Database management system|DBMS class]];
- Have variable of [[Network module|network interface]].

## Interpreting process
Interpreter has stack for variables and specific data.

Method interpret will be work by ==while (true)== with moving to next command that must be executed by interpreter.

For returning and going to another method interpreter will push to stack specific data, called program point that will give interpret point where it must continue executing.

It can be made so Every command in methods separated to elementary action.

## Combination class and struct

## OOP
Private and public class elements.

## Methods for undo marks for set, remove vertexes, nodes or sub_nodes in SemanticWebWithIndexingDbController

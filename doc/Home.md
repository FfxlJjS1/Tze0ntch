# Info
**Tze0ntch** is a open-source system of multiuser client-server DBMS with interpretator, include metaprogramming.

It's program for storing and automatic process data by algorithms, and update algorithms, if it is necessary.

**Functions:**
- Store data in files or RAM for access him;
- Execute hybrid interpreting algorithms which contains in DBs;
- Change algorithms for hybrid interpreting;
- Network communication between client and server systems.

**Starting goal is learning and practice creating of DBMS and interpretator.**

**Ultimate goal is making AI.**

**System contents three modules:**
- **DBMS** for working with databases;
- **Interpreter** for executing algorithms and working with DBMS;
- **Network interface** for communicate with exclude client.

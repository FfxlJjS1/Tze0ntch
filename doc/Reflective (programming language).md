Functionality programming is programming paradigm, in which calculation process treated as calculating the value of a function in the understanding of mathematics.

==!In the future will added object-orientation paradigm for simplify view of code and to small it's size and difficult.==

## Principles of the programming language
- Abstracting code from realization;
- Static typing;

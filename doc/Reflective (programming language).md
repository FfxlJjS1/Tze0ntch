# Info
**Reflective** is programming language for Tze0ntch interpreter. It's for ***functionality programming module***.

Programming module is program structure as complex of small independences blocks, called module, which structure and behavior is seek the rules.

Functionality programming is programming paradigm, in which calculation process treated as calculating the value of a function in the understanding of mathematics.

==!In the future may be will be added object-orientation paradigm for simplify view of code and to small it's size and difficult.==

## Principles of the programming language
- Abstracting code from realization;
- Static typing;
- Elementary limited and unlimited variables;
- Giving an object (au user class, an array or a structure) to method without coping data of the object.

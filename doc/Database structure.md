# Info
**Database structure** refers to the organization and layout of a database.

Different types of database have different structural characteristics.
For example, a relational database typically has a tabular structure, while a document database a hierarchical or nested structure.
No matter the type, a well-designed database structure is a key foundation for effective data management.

Only **customizable database structure** is structure, that can be **realizable by algorithms in DBMS**

## Principles
- Each database file **has a database structure type id as the first bytes in the database file**, the same as in [[System database|the system database]]

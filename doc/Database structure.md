# Info
**Database structure** refers to the organization and layout of a database.

Different types of database have different structural characteristics.
For example, a relational database typically has a tabular structure, while a document database a hierarchical or nested structure.
No matter the type, a well-designed database structure is a key foundation for effective data management.
